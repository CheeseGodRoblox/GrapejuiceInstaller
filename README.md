# RoJuicer
#### Roblox on Linux Simplified

### âš  Please keep in mind that RoJuicer was a small project created by me to learn more about coding. This project is now inactive and NOT RECOMMENDED FOR MODERN USE. If the installation does not work, you'll have to install Grapejuice normally. DO NOT EXPECT ANY SUPPORT on issues you've encountered.

#### This script will install the following (in this order):<br/>
1- Dependencies of the script itself:<br/>
-"git" for package installation<br/>
-"p7zip-full"<br/>
-"curl" for acquiring script to fix cursor bug<br/>
-"python3" to run Grapejuice installation commands<br/>
<br/>
2- The latest version of Wine Development* (which is currently needed for running Roblox Player)<br/>
3- Wine modification script to fix cursor getting stuck (downloaded and initialized from the link: "https://pastebin.com/raw/5SeVb005")<br/>
4- Grapejuice (manager), Roblox Player (beta with the new browserless interface), and Roblox Studio<br/>
*=Optional, you have the chance when in the install script<br/>
<br/>

#### INSTALLATION:<br/>
```
git clone https://github.com/CheeseGodRoblox/RoJuicer
cd RoJuicer
chmod +x installer.sh
./installer.sh
```

NOTE: Instead of using ```git clone``` you can instead go to Releases and download the latest release. This can ensure you have as stable an experience as possible.

#### FAQS: <br/>
Does this program need Internet to function?<br/>
Yes, this script requires that you have an Internet connection to download necessary files, as well as to install dependencies and Grapejuice themselves.<br/>

Can I edit and distribute this code as my own?<br/>
Yes, feel free to edit and change/distribute this code. It's protected with the GPL 3.0 License, so as long as it's Open-Source, and you credit this original creation, you're good.<br/>
